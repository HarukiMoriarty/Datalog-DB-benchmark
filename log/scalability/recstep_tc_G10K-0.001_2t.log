EDB_DECL:
Arc(x int, y int)

IDB_DECL:
Tc(x int, y int)

RULE_DECL:
0: Tc(x, y) :- Arc(x, y).
1: Tc(x, y) :- Arc(z, y), Tc(x, z).

DEPENDENCY_GRAPH: 

rule 0: set()
rule 1: {0, 1}
Number of the rule strongly connected components (rscc): 2

rule strongly connected components in reverse evaluation order: 
<rscc index>: <rscc key> - <indices of rules>

rscc 0: 1-[1]
rscc 1: 0-[0]

No directed cycle with a negative edge being detected:
The Datalog program is stratifiable

Rule Groups (in evaluation order):

rule indices: [0]
Tc(x, y) :- Arc(x, y).

rule indices: [1]
Tc(x, y) :- Arc(z, y), Tc(x, z).
