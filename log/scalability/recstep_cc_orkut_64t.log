Number of the rule strongly connected components (rscc): 3

rule strongly connected components in reverse evaluation order: 
<rscc index>: <rscc key> - <indices of rules>

rscc 0: 2-[2]
rscc 1: 1-[1]
rscc 2: 0-[0]

No directed cycle with a negative edge being detected:
The Datalog program is stratifiable
